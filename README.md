# DnD: TL;DR

## A Fast and Loose Guide to Dungeons and Dragons

#### by Rich Jones

_Too long, didn't read: This guide makes DnD super fun and easy._

<!--Dungeons and Dragons is fun, but super complicated by default. It can be very overwhelming for new players as there as so many unnecessary rules.-->

This is a guide for new players and dungeon masters who want to play a **fast-paced, fun-optimized** version of the game. We prefer fun and hilarity over rule-following.

Ideally, this guide should be all you need to play a fun game with friends, newbies, normies, hesitant significant others, skeptics and moms. Typically people who have watched Stranger Things are pretty into it.

## Requirements
_TL;DR: Friends, a printer, some PDFs, some pens, hecka beers._

* 2-4 **players** + 1 **Dungeon Master** üë®üë©üë®üë©
* **Pen and paper** for each player üìùüìùüìùüìù
* A set of **game dice** for each player üé≤üé≤üé≤üé≤
   * Or, use your phone. You can say "Siri, roll a D20" to an iPhone and it works.
* 4-6 **beers** per player üç∫üç∫üç∫üç∫
* Costumes/Hats (Optional)
	* The game is more fun if you all get into character with dorky hats

## Basic Overview

_TL;DR: Invent a character, explore a fantasy world, talk to the people living there, fight crazy monsters, acquire plunder and glory, roll dice, drink beers, yell at your friends and have fun._

Dungeons and Dragons a fantasy role playing game. The game is played by 2-4 **player characters**, who play as adventurers exploring a world, and one **Dungeon Master**, who controls the context of the adventure and plays as the **non-player characters** and **monsters**.

There are very few rules to the game, so creativity and ingenuity are rewarded. The players will be placed into challenging situations, (such as fighting an army of monsters, discovering and deciphering mysterious clues, and interrogating, seducing and deceiving non-player characters), and will have to use their imaginations to devise ways to overcome those challenges.

The primary mechanic of the game is the roll of a 20-sided dice known as a **D20**. Players state what they want to do (for instance, _"I want to use the rope to swing across the chasm"_), and then roll a D20. 

The Dungeon Master decides to themself how difficult that task is (out of 20), and if the dice scores higher than that number then the player succeeds, and if not then they fail. The Dungeon Master then narrates the result of the action (_"You try to swing across the gaping chasm, but your grip slips half-way across, and you fall to the canyon floor. You take two damage. You see glowing eyes in the darkness."_)

Natural rolls of 1 and 20 result in spectacular failures and success, respectively.

The goal of the game is simply to play the game, because it is fun! 

## Making Characters
_TL;DR: Choose a character type. Print a [premade sheet](character_sheets/). In a pinch, pretend to be Han Solo or Darth Vader but as a Lord of the Rings character._

<!--Character creation is the longest, most confusing and most boring part of the game for new players. We're going to skip all of the pointless parts and just get to the good stuff.-->

Every player besides the Dungeon Master needs to create a character. This will be something like _Riceak Beestinger, Chaotic Gnomish Druid_, or _Hollyatra Gellantara, Lawful Human Paladin_.

Each player will need to choose a **race**, a **class**, an **alignment**, and a **name**. Then, print the character sheet for that combination from the [PDFs in this repository, linked below](character_sheets/). Choose a combination that you think will be fun to play as.

You'll probably want to make sure that your party has good a balance of skills and personalities. _You can't all be Han Solo!_

If you're super lazy, just use these characters for your party, which should suit any starting campaign:

* [Half-Orc Barbarian](character_sheets/half-orc_barbarian.pdf)
* [Human Cleric](character_sheets/human_cleric.pdf)
* [Elven Ranger](character_sheets/elf_ranger.pdf)
* [Tiefling Rogue](character_sheets/tiefling_rogue.pdf) 

Players can do this themselves before the session starts to save time, or the DM can just print out a bunch of the archetypical character types for players to choose from, or you can print them on demand.

### Race
_TL;DR: What do you look like?_

Race defines the **general physical characterics** of your character. 

Race can affect how people interact with your character. Non-player characters in the games may have their own racial prejudices - for instances, if you go to a Dwarfen cave, the Dwarves there might be racist towards your Elf player. This can lead to some funny situations. 

Also, big characters can throw small charactors, which is always funny.

Choose one:

| Race    | Size | Attributes|
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| Halfling      | Tiny | Nimble, brave |
| Gnome      | Very Small | Cunning, sees in the dark |
| Dwarf      | Small | Resilient, sees in the dark |
| Elf      | Short | Keen senses |
| Half-Elf      | Short-ish | Fairly useless |
| Tiefling      | Regular | Has horns and a tail |
| Human        | Regular | You know what humans are |
| Half-Orc        | Tall | Savage |
| Dragonborn       | Taller | Scales, tough |

### Class
_TL;DR: What can you do?_

Class defines the **skills and abilities** of your character. 

Some can use magic, some are good at melee combat, some are good a ranged weaponry, and some are good at seduction. Pick the one that you think would be fun role play as!

| Class    | Quality | Good at |
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| Barbarian      | Strong | Hitting things |
| Bard      | Musical | Seduction |
| Cleric      | Religious magic | Healing |
| Druid      | Natural magic | Potions, plants/animals |
| Fighter    | Combat | Fighting. Duh. |
| Monk      | Natural magic | Potions, plants/animals |
| Paladin      | Religious knight | Religious violence, chivalry |
| Ranger      | Scouting | Archery, stealth |
| Rogue      | Criminal | Thievery, lockpicking, ruses |
| Sorcerer      | Energy magic | Cool spells |
| Warlock      | War magic | Cool spells |
| Wizard      | General magic | Cool spells |

### Alignment
_TL;DR: How do you behave - good or bad? Lawful or criminal?_

Alignment describes your character's **motivations and behavior**. There are two axis here: good and evil, lawful and chaotic. These map pretty well to archetypical movie characters, Darth Vader is lawful evil, Han Solo is chaotic neutral, etc. 

Again, choose one you think would be fun:

| Lawful Good (Superman) | Neutral Good (Gandalf) | Chaotic Good (Batman) |
|:------------- |:----------------|:-------------|
| **Lawful Neutral (Stannis Baratheon)** | **True Neutral (Saul Goodman)** | **Chaotic Neutral (Han Solo)** |
| **Lawful Evil (Darth Vader)** | **Neutral Evil (Voldemort)**  | **Chaotic Evil (The Joker)** |

### Name

Finally, make a name. A good DM will enforce that you call all the other players by their character names, so **make sure yours is funny**. Try a dick or a poop joke here.

Alternately, you can just use this [character name generator](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/article5.asp?x=dnd/dx20010202b) and see what happens.

#### Character Sheets

Now that you've chosen your **race**, **class**, **alignment** and **name**, find the right **character sheet** for that combination of race and class in [this directory](/character_sheets) and print it out. This is yours now. Fill in your alignment and name at the top, then read over the sheet. You'll see that you already have your stats calculated and a list of weapons and items in your inventory that you'll start the game with. Hooray!

## Gameplay
_TL;DR: Just roll a D20 and see what happens._

Okay! Now you're ready to play. The Dungeon Master is going to read a little narative exposition, then you're off!

There are three pillars to gameplay: **exploration** of the game world, **interaction** with non-player characters, and **combat** with monsters.

### Exploration
_TL;DR: Look for clues, traps, treasure and secrets._

* Exploring environments
* Solving puzzles
* Surmounting obstacles
* Looking for treasure
* Discovering traps
* Lockpicking
* Setting traps
* Starting fires

### Interaction
_TL;DR: Use disguises and sexuality to acquire information._

Eventually, players will encounter non-player characters. These might be guards, townsfolk, nobility, evil generals, holy spirits or anything else. Generally, they will have some information for the players that they'll need to acquire somehow. This isn't always easy, and often involves the use of:

* Seduction and sexual intrigue
* Interrogation
* Lying
* Racial discrimination
* Language barriers
* Kidnapping
* Torture
* Slight-of-hand
* Bribery
* Disguise

### Combat
_TL;DR: Roll a D20 to see if you hit or not, then roll another dice to see how much damage you did._

## Dungeon Mastering
_TL;DR: Make your players have as much fun as possible by being kind of a dick._

As a dungeon master, your job is to make the other players have as much fun as possible.

Different players like different things, so feel free to adjust your campaign to suit their needs.

### Premade Campaigns

The internet is full of pre-made campaigns of varying quality. Most of the official ones can be bought for a few bucks each, but you can also generally find the PDFs on sketchy Russian download websites.

I like the _Adventurer's League_ series because the missions are short and the files are well formatted, but because the missions are short they don't go as deep. Try to find one that's right for your players!
